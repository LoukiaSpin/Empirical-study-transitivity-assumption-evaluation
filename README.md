# Low awareness of the transitivity assumption in complex networks of interventions: a systematic survey from 721 network meta-analyses


## Description of the repository

The repository offers the typical structure of separate folders for data, and R (scripts and .RData):
* The _data_ folder includes the file __Analysis dataset.RData__ that contains the extracted data for all items from the collected 721 systematic reviews. 
* The _R_ folder includes the R scripts to create Table 2 and all main and supplementary Figures of the article. The corresponding homonymous R scripts load the file __Analysis dataset.RData__. 

After downloading/cloning the repo, the user can use the .Rproj file to source all code.
